## Overview

BOZLY is an AI-agnostic framework for deploying domain-specific workspaces. It provides context management, session continuity, and vault orchestration across any AI provider (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local LLMs).

**Key Differentiator:** BOZLY is NOT a Claude plugin. It's an independent framework that works with ANY AI CLI.

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript | Matches Cline/Cursor ecosystem |
| Storage | JSON files | Simple, debuggable (SQLite later if needed) |
| AI Support | AI-agnostic | Works with any AI CLI |
| Platforms | macOS, Linux, WSL2 | Unix-native, no native Windows |
| Distribution | npm, Homebrew, git clone | Standard package managers |

---

## Phase 1: Beta (v0.3.0) - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Minimal working product with core vault functionality + LogicFlows patterns

**Status:** 100% Complete (18 sessions)

### LogicFlows Pattern Implementation

| Pattern | Decision | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **7: Domain Models** | INCLUDE | `.bozly/models/` directory |
| **2: Transparency** | INCLUDE | Full session logging (6 files per session) |
| **4: Versioning** | INCLUDE | Semver for models with history |
| **5: Schema Validation** | SKIP | Noted for Phase 3+ |

### CLI Commands (All Implemented)

```bash
# Core
bozly init # Initialize node in current directory
bozly list                    # List registered nodes
bozly add <path>              # Register existing node
bozly remove <vault>          # Remove vault (with backup)
bozly status                  # Show node status

# Context
bozly context                 # Generate context for AI

## Phase 2: Automation & Integrations (v0.4.0 - v0.5.0)

**Goal:** Smart routing + visual UI + n8n orchestration + session memory

**Timeline:** 32-44 hours AI-assisted development (~2-3 weeks)

**Target:** January 2026

### Vault Server UI (`bozly serve`)

Local web dashboard for visual node management:

```bash
bozly serve                   # Start local server (http://localhost:3847)
bozly serve --port 8080       # Custom port
```

**Features:**
- Vault selector and dashboard
- Session browser with filtering
- Command runner from UI
- Context editor
- Session diff viewer
- "Open in Obsidian" integration

**Implementation:** 3 phases, 18-26 hours total

### Smart Routing

Per-vault and per-command AI provider configuration:

```yaml
# .bozly/config.json
{
  "routing": {
    "default": "claude",
    "commands": {
      "quick-task": "ollama/llama3",
      "code-review": "claude"
    },
    "fallback": ["ollama", "gpt"]
  }
}
```

### Auto-Cleanup & Disk Management

Prevent session bloat with automatic cleanup:

```bash
bozly cleanup --preview       # Show what would be cleaned
bozly cleanup --older-than 90d  # Clean old sessions
bozly status --storage        # View storage usage
```

**Features:**
- Session retention policy (configurable, default 90 days)
- Session archival (compress to .tar.gz)
- Storage monitoring and warnings
- Auto-cleanup when exceeding thresholds

### n8n Workflow Orchestration

External workflow automation:

- File system monitoring (`.bozly/sessions/`)
- Webhook endpoints for triggers
- CLI-based execution from n8n
- Session automation pipelines

### Template & Command Tooling (Design Complete)

- `bozly command create` — Interactive wizard for creating commands
- `bozly commands` — List all commands (vault + global) with source
- `bozly template create` — Interactive wizard for creating templates
- `bozly template list` — List available templates
- Default global commands (3-5 starters shipped with BOZLY)
- User templates equal to built-in (no namespacing)

### Core Automation Features

- Hooks system (session-start, session-end, post-execution)
- Workflows (multi-step processes with conditional logic)
- Cross-node queries (`bozly search --all`)
- Session history viewer (`bozly history`)
- Task tracking (`bozly tasks`)

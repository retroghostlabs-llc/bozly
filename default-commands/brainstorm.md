# Brainstorm

Help me brainstorm and explore ideas:
1. Generate 5-10 creative approaches or angles
2. Challenge assumptions - what if the opposite were true?
3. Identify patterns from analogous domains
4. Suggest wild ideas (even if impractical)
5. Distill into 2-3 promising directions to explore

Keep ideas diverse and encourage unconventional thinking.
